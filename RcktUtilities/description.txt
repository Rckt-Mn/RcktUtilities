Rckt.Utilities adds tools, blocks, and other items to reduce repetetive tasks add add new features. An example would be the Luminite Hammer which has an insanely fast hammer speed allowing walls to be destroyed quickly while making large arenas or buildings but has no other practical use. This mod is not intended to affect game progression in any way or make the game easier or harder. More info can be found on the RcktUtilities Github: https://github.com/Rckt-Mn/RcktUtilities. All files are open sources and you can do whatever you want with them. If you have any suggestions, criticisms, or issues with the mod please contact me through Github or Rocket Man#9092 on discord.
